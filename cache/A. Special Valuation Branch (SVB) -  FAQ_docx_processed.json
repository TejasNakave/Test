What is the Special Valuation Branch (SVB)?\nThe Special Valuation Branch is a specialized wing of Indian Customs that examines imports between related parties or cases involving royalties, technical collaboration, or license fees.\nIt ensures that the declared transaction value of imported goods is not influenced by relationships between the importer and supplier and is compliant with Customs Valuation Rules, 2007.\n\n2. When is SVB applicable?\nSVB applies when:\nThe importer and foreign supplier are related (parent company, subsidiary, group entity, or common directors).\nImports involve royalty or license fees (directly or indirectly related to imported goods).\nThere is a technical collaboration agreement affecting the price.\nTransfer pricing agreements impact the declared invoice value.\nNot applicable for:\nPurely independent party transactions.\nOne-time imports without long-term collaboration.\nImport of goods without any price influence or royalty/license conditions.\n\n3. Which laws govern SVB?\nSection 14 of the Customs Act, 1962 (transaction value determination).\nCustoms Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007.\nCBEC Circulars 4/2016-Cus and 5/2016-Cus (Feb 2016) – revamped SVB procedures.\n\n\n\n\n4. Who has to file with SVB?\nImporters who:\nImport from related parties.\nHave royalty/license fee agreements linked to imports.\nAre under technical collaboration agreements with suppliers.\n\n5. Where do I file SVB applications?\nAt the Custom House where your goods are regularly cleared (called the port of import).\nFor example: If your imports arrive at Air Cargo Complex, Mumbai, you file with the SVB section of Mumbai Customs at Ballard Pier-New Customs House, 8th Floor, Mumbai 01.\n\n6. What is the SVB process?\nFiling application: Submit SVB questionnaire (Annexure A) with supporting agreements (pricing, royalty, technical collaboration, etc.).\nProvisional assessment: Customs may assess imports provisionally while SVB is pending. Importer executes a Provisional Duty (PD) Bond and deposits security.\nExamination: SVB scrutinizes documents, may seek additional clarifications.\nSVB Order: Final findings are issued confirming whether the transaction value is acceptable or requires adjustments.\n\n7. What documents are required for SVB?\nApplication (Annexure A) with importer & supplier details.\nCopy of agreements: Royalty, technical collaboration, license agreements.\nPrice list & invoice samples.\nTransfer pricing documents (if any).\nCompany relationship proof (shareholding pattern, board structure).\nPrevious import details (last 3 years).\n\n\n\n\n8. How long does SVB take?\nTypically 2–3 months from filing, depending on query responses and document completeness.\nImports can continue provisionally during the pendency of SVB clearance.\n\n9. What happens if I don’t file SVB when required?\nYour imports may be provisionally assessed with extra duty deposits.\nPenalties may be imposed for non-compliance.\nDelays in clearance of goods.\n\n10. Is SVB a one-time or recurring process?\nSVB is usually a one-time registration for a particular importer-supplier relationship & agreement.\nHowever:\nIf a new agreement (e.g., new royalty/license terms) is signed, you must update SVB.\nPeriodic reviews may be undertaken by Customs.\n\n11. How much security deposit is needed for provisional clearance?\nAs per CBEC Circular 4/2016, provisional assessments require:\nPD Bond for the differential duty amount.\nNo extra duty deposit (EDD) is generally collected now (earlier it was 1–5%).\n\n12. Can I import goods while SVB is pending?\nYes. Imports are allowed under provisional assessment after executing the PD Bond and fulfilling Customs conditions.\n\n13. How long is an SVB order valid?\n\nUsually valid for the duration of the underlying agreement (e.g., license/royalty agreement).\nCustoms may review periodically or when agreements are modified.\n\n14. Do I need to reapply if my supplier changes?\nYes, if the new supplier is also related or there’s a new agreement impacting value. Each importer-supplier relationship requires a separate SVB filing.\n\n15. Does SVB affect my transfer pricing?\nCustoms and Income Tax have separate valuation mechanisms. SVB focuses on Customs valuation under Section 14 and Rules, which may differ from Income Tax transfer pricing norms.\n\n16. Can I appeal against an SVB order?\nYes. If dissatisfied, you can file an appeal with the Commissioner (Appeals) under Section 128 of the Customs Act, 1962.\n\n17.
