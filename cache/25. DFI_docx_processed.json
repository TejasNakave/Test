  "content": "DGFT Application Process – Broad Guidelines\n\n1. Application Forms (ANFs)\nANF = Aayat Niryat Form prescribed under Foreign Trade Policy (FTP).\nEach service (IEC, Advance Authorisation, EPCG, SEIS, RoDTEP, etc.) has a specific ANF.\nExample:\nIEC – ANF 2A\nAdvance Authorisation – ANF 4A / 4B\nEPCG – ANF 5A\nSEIS – ANF 3B\nExport House Status – ANF 3C\n\n📌 Rule: Always download the latest ANF version from DGFT portal → “Forms & Appendices” section.\n\n2. Appendices\nAppendices are supporting formats, declarations, or certificates required along with ANFs.\nExample:\nAppendix 2K – Chartered Accountant/Cost Accountant certificate for turnover.\nAppendix 3A – CA Certificate for SEIS.\nAppendix 5A – Certificate for EPCG redemption.\nEach scheme has mandatory appendices to certify export performance, consumption norms, etc.\n\n📌 Tip: Match Appendix number with ANF requirements before submission.\n\n3. Attachments / Supporting Documents\nCommonly required documents include:\nIEC copy, PAN, GST certificate\nExport performance statements\nChartered Accountant certificates (turnover/FOB values)\nProof of installation (for EPCG)\nBoard resolution / authorization (if needed)\nUpload only in PDF format (max size as per DGFT portal rules).\n\n4. Filing Process\nLogin to DGFT portal (using DSC/e-sign and IEC-based credentials).\nSelect Service → Fill relevant ANF online.\nUpload Appendices & Attachments as per checklist.\nPay application fee online via payment gateway.\nSubmit with DSC/e-sign → Generate e-filing acknowledgement.\nTrack Status → DGFT portal “My Dashboard”.\nDeficiency Letters (if any) → Respond within prescribed time.\nFinal Approval → License/Scrip issued electronically (with QR code).\n\n5. Common Guidelines\nAlways use CA/CS certified data where turnover/export figures are involved.\nEnsure HS Codes, IEC, RCMC (EPC Registration) are updated before applying.\nFor benefits (SEIS, RoDTEP, ROSCTL), application timelines are strict – apply within FTP deadlines.\nKeep a master compliance folder with export invoices, shipping bills, and e-BRCs ready for audit/verification.\n\n✅ In short: ANF = Application Form, Appendix = Supporting Certificate, Attachments = Evidence → All filed online through DGFT portal with DSC/e-sign + fees → Scrutiny → Approval/License/Scrip issued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDGFT Applications – Checklist\n\n✅ General for all applications:\nDigital Signature Certificate (DSC) of Authorised Signatory\nIEC must be active & updated\nRCMC (Registration with Export Promotion Council) valid\ne-BRCs (bank realisation certificates) for exports involving incentives\nChartered Accountant / Engineer certificates as per scheme\n\n\n\nDGFT application fee structure (scheme-wise), based on the latest Appendix 2K under the Foreign Trade Policy 2023, updated through Public Notice No. 02/2025–26 dated April 15, 2025:\n\nDGFT Fee Structure – Scheme-Wise Overview (Appendix 2K)\n\nAdditional Fees for Advance Authorization — Composition Fee (Extension of EO Period)\nAdvance Authorization (AA) extension or regularisation requests via Policy Relaxation Committee (PRC) attract a non-refundable composition fee, tiered by CIF value:\n\nSummary & Tips\nFees vary by scheme and applicant type — MSMEs benefit from significantly lower charges, especially for Advance Authorization and EPCG.\nIMS system (like SIMS/CIMS) requires a flat ₹500 registration fee.\nComposition fees are charged separately for EO extensions — important to factor for Advance Autorisation holders.\nAll applications are submitted online via DGFT portal and payments made through integrated payment gateways or e-MPS.  \nNo refunds are available unless paid in excess or paid mistakenly—a refund request must be made via ANF-2G and is processed only within one year.  \n\n🔹 Redemption / Closure Procedure for DGFT Authorisations\n\n1. Fulfilment of Export Obligation (EO)\nExport Obligation (EO) is to be met as per the terms of the authorisation:\nAdvance Authorization (AA): Physical exports / deemed exports equivalent to CIF imports.\nEPCG: Export obligation equivalent to multiple of duty saved (6x / 8x) within specified period.\nDFIA: Similar to AA, but transferable after EO.\n\n2. Documentation to be maintained\nShipping Bills (EP Copy / Exchange Control Copy) – proof of exports.\nE-BRC (Bank Realisation Certificates) issued by AD Bank – proof of foreign exchange realisation.\nARE-1 / Tax invoices / Deemed export documents (if applicable).\nConsumption certificate / Appendix 23 (if required for AA) certified by Chartered Accountant/Cost Accountant.\nInstallation Certificate (for EPCG) certified by jurisdictional Customs Authority.\nProof of Customs Duty Payment / Debit entries (where applicable).\n\n3. Customs Angle\nImports under DGFT licences are recorded in ICEGATE and linked with DGFT.\nAt time of redemption:\nEDI system auto-matches imports & exports.\nCustoms issues an Export Obligation Discharge Certificate (EODC) recommendation to DGFT in some cases.\nFor EPCG authorisations – Customs checks installation certificate and EO fulfilment before clearing closure.\n\n\n4. Bank Angle (AD Bank)\t\nExport proceeds realisation is mandatory (within RBI timelines).\nAD Bank issues E-BRC only after forex realisation.\nDGFT accepts only electronic E-BRC uploaded by the Bank on DGFT server.\nIf exports are under Rupee Trade Arrangement (like with Russia, Sri Lanka, Iran etc.), AD issues eBRC in INR against Special Vostro account.\n\n5. Application to DGFT for Redemption / EODC\nApplicant applies online on DGFT portal:\nFile in ANF-4F (for Advance Authorisation / DFIA).\nFile in ANF-5B (for EPCG).\nUpload:\ne-BRCs, Shipping Bills, Import details, Chartered Accountant Certificate.\nInstallation Certificate (for EPCG).\nPay applicable application fee (₹500 – ₹1,000 depending on type).\n\n6. DGFT Verification Process\nDGFT auto-fetches Shipping Bill data from ICEGATE and E-BRC data from Banks.\nMatching of:\nExport quantity/value with Import quantity/value (AA).\nExport FOB value with Duty saved value (EPCG).\nIf complete – DGFT issues Redemption Letter / EODC (Export Obligation Discharge Certificate).\nIf shortfall – case referred to Policy Relaxation Committee (PRC) with composition fee / additional duty payment.\n\n7. Post-Redemption\nRedemption Letter / EODC is uploaded on DGFT Portal.\nCustoms is auto-updated, and no further demand of duty arises.\nAD Bank can close the case in its records as export proceeds have been realised and EO fulfilled.\n\n🔹 Key Notes\nPartial Redemption: Allowed if part EO fulfilled. Balance obligation continues.\nClubbing of Authorisations: Possible before redemption (with conditions).\nBlock-wise EO for EPCG: Minimum 50% EO in first block, balance in next block.\nComposition Fee: Payable if EO period extension or shortfall regularisation is required.\nCustoms Bond / Bank Guarantee: Released only after submission of Redemption/EODC to Customs.\n\nIn short:\nExport as per authorisation → 2. Realisation via Bank (E-BRC) → 3. Customs validation of imports/exports → 4. Apply to DGFT with ANF & docs → 5. DGFT verifies & issues Redemption/EODC → 6. Submit EODC to Customs/Bank → 7. Bonds/Guarantees released.\n\n\nPractical checklist: \nA. Common Documents Required for DGFT Incentive Applications\n\n(Applicable for schemes like SEIS, RoDTEP, ROSCTL, Duty Drawback, AA, EPCG, MEIS – where incentives/scrips are claimed)\n\nBasic Entity Documents\nIEC (Importer Exporter Code) copy (latest, updated).\nRCMC (Registration-cum-Membership Certificate) with relevant EPC.\nGST Registration Certificate (if applicable).\nPAN, CIN (for company), address proof of registered office.\n\nExport Transaction Documents\nShipping Bills (EP Copy / EDI Data auto-fetched).\nE-BRC (Bank Realisation Certificate) from AD Bank (mandatory for forex realisation).\nExport invoices & packing lists.\nBill of Lading / Airway Bill / Courier Waybill (as applicable).\nCA/CPA certificate (for value, nexus, eligibility depending on scheme).\n\nScheme-specific Additional Docs\nSEIS: Declaration of services rendered, foreign exchange earnings statement, CA certificate.\nRoDTEP/ROSCTL: Just Shipping Bill & EDI export data (system driven).\nMEIS (older cases): Electronic Shipping Bill, CA Certificate.\nAA/EPCG (incentive claim stage): Copy of licence, proof of installation (for EPCG), consumption certificate (for AA).\n\n📑 B.
