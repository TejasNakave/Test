What is the Customs Tariff?\nIn India, the customs tariff is legally defined in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975.\nIt contains two schedules:\nFirst Schedule → Basic customs duty rates for all imported goods, arranged by HS codes (Harmonised System of Nomenclature).\nSecond Schedule → Export duties (applied to a small number of items).\nIt’s the legal base for duty rates before applying any FTA or special exemption.\n\n2. Customs Tariff and FTAs\nUnder an FTA, the normal duty rate from the First Schedule can be reduced or made zero.\nThis is implemented via a Customs Notification issued under Section 25(1) of the Customs Act, 1962.\nExample: For India–UAE CEPA, Notification No. 22/2022-Customs specifies the reduced tariff rates for eligible products.\n\n3. How to Read a Customs Tariff Entry\n\nEvery entry typically shows:\nHS Code (8-digit in India).\nDescription of Goods.\nUnit of measurement (e.g., kg, pieces).\nStandard duty rate (ad valorem % or specific amount).\nOther applicable duties → Social Welfare Surcharge, IGST, Compensation Cess, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Customs Duty Is Calculated in India\n\nCustoms duty isn’t a single tax—imports into India are subject to multiple components:\nBasic Customs Duty (BCD) – Charged based on the assessable CIF (Cost + Insurance + Freight) value of goods. This can be ad valorem (percentage) or specific (per unit).  \nSocial Welfare Surcharge – Levied at a rate of 10% on BCD, supporting domestic welfare schemes.  \nIntegrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) – Applied on the sum of CIF + BCD + Social Welfare Surcharge. The IGST rate mirrors the GST slabs (0–28%).  \nOther Possible Duties:\nAnti-dumping duties\nSafeguard duties\nCompensation cess (on luxury items, etc.)\nAgriculture Infrastructure Development Cess (AIDC) on certain goods\nThese depend on product category and origin.  \n\nExample Import Duty Calculation \n\nLet’s calculate import duty for an item with a CIF value of ₹100:\nUsing a basic duty rate of 30%, plus IGST and surcharges:\nAssessable value (A): ₹100\nBCD (30% of 100): ₹30\nSocial Welfare Surcharge (10% of 30): ₹3\nSubtotal: ₹100 + ₹30 + ₹3 = ₹133\nIGST (18% of 133): ₹23.94\nTotal Customs Duty (Approx): ₹30 + ₹3 + ₹23.94 = ₹56.94\nTotal Landed Cost: ₹100 + ₹56.94 = ₹156.94\n\nTools & Calculators You Can Use\n\n1. \nICEGATE Custom Duty Calculator (Government of India)\nOfficial and reliable.\nRequires login/registration.\nCalculates duty based on HS code and origin.  \n\nSummary Table\n\n\n4. Key Legal References\nCustoms Tariff Act, 1975 → Statutory framework for rates.\nSection 25, Customs Act, 1962 → Power to grant FTA-based exemptions.\nCAROTAR, 2020 → Verifying origin before applying reduced rates.\nDGFT Notifications/Public Notices → FTA operational instructions.\n\n5. FTA Tariff Decoding Example\n\nWithout FTA:\nHS 61091000 (T-shirts, cotton): Basic Customs Duty = 10%.\n\nWith FTA (India–Australia ECTA):\nTariff schedule shows → Year 1: 5%, Year 2: 0%.\nApply Customs Notification for ECTA to claim reduced duty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Study:\n\nIf the importer does not submit freight and insurance details, Indian Customs does not leave them blank — they use prescribed default values under the Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007, framed under Section 14 of the Customs Act, 1962.\n\n1. Legal Basis\nSection 14, Customs Act, 1962 → Customs duty is based on the transaction value (CIF value — Cost, Insurance, Freight).\nRule 10, Customs Valuation Rules, 2007 → If freight/insurance isn’t available, Customs will add standard amounts.\n\n2. Default Additions When Values Are Missing\n\nA. Freight\n\nIf freight cost is not available:\nBy Air: Add 20% of FOB value or the actual freight, whichever is lower.\nBy Sea: Add actual cost, or if unavailable, 20% of FOB value.\n\n(FOB = Free on Board value = value of goods at export without freight & insurance)\n\nB. Insurance\n\nIf insurance cost is not available:\nAdd 1.125% of FOB value as notional insurance cost.\n\n3. Example Calculation Without Submitted Freight & Insurance\n\nLet’s say:\nFOB value = ₹1,00,000\nMode = Sea\nBCD = 10%\nIGST = 18%\nFreight & Insurance not declared.\n\nStep 1: Calculate CIF value\nFreight = 20% of FOB = ₹20,000\nInsurance = 1.125% of FOB = ₹1,125\nCIF = ₹1,00,000 + ₹20,000 + ₹1,125 = ₹1,21,125\n\nStep 2: Apply Customs Duties\nBCD = 10% of ₹1,21,125 = ₹12,112.50\nSocial Welfare Surcharge (SWS) = 10% of BCD = ₹1,211.25\nIGST = 18% of (₹1,21,125 + ₹12,112.50 + ₹1,211.25)\n= 18% of ₹1,34,448.75 = ₹24,200.78\n\nStep 3: Total Duty Payable\n= ₹12,112.50 (BCD) + ₹1,211.25 (SWS) + ₹24,200.78 (IGST)\n= ₹37,524.53\n\n\n",
